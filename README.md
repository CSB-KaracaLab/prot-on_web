### PROT-ON: A Structure-Based Detection of Designer PROTein Interface MutatiONs

### Background

PROT-ON aims to identify key protein-protein interaction (PPI) mutations that can aid in redesigning new protein binders. It accomplishes this by using the coordinates of a protein complex to explore all possible interface mutations on a selected protein monomer with either [EvoEF1](https://github.com/tommyhuangthu/EvoEF) or [FoldX](http://foldxsuite.crg.eu/). The resulting mutational landscape is then filtered based on stability and, optionally, mutability criteria. Finally, PROT-ON performs a statistical analysis of the energy landscape created by the mutations to suggest the most enriching and depleting interfacial mutations for binding. PROT-ON can work on both [stand-alone](https://github.com/CSB-KaracaLab/prot-on) and [PROT-ON webserver](http://proton.tools.ibg.edu.tr:8001).

### PROT-ON Architecture

#### Code Architecture

The PROT-ON tool is designed with a modular architecture that includes the following components:
1. **Interface Analysis**: Identifying interfacial amino acids.  (`interface_residues.py`).
2. **Mutation Modeling**: Using EvoEF1 and FoldX to generate mutants and calculate binding energies  (`energy_calculation_[EvoEF/FoldX].py`).
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Classifying the mutations based on their impact on binding energy  (`detect_outliers.py`).

</p>

#### Webserver Architecture

PROT-ON's web application was developed using Flask, Bootstrap, HTTP, CSS, JavaScript, Celery, RabbitMQ, SQLAlchemy, Nginx, Gunicorn, and Supervisor packages and services. The purpose for using these packages and services are provided below.

1. **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Bootstrap for the user interface.
2. **Backend**: Python scripts and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) for handling requests and running the mutation analysis.
3. **Database**: Storing data with SQLAlchemy.
4. **Task Queue**: Using [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python) and [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/) for managing background tasks.
5. **Server**: Deploying the webserver with [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/), supervisor and gunicorn.

```

PROT-ON will deploy to your IP/domain address after completing these instructions. If you prefer to deploy it on a specific domain, please enter your domain as a string in the `hostname` variable within `app.py` (PROT-ON's default domain is proton.tools.ibg.edu.tr:8001). You can also change the e-mail address to which the results are sent. For this, Please press `command/ctrl + f`, type `Fill with your e-mail here`, and edit with your e-mail in `app.py` script. Also if needed, you must change `MAIL_PORT`. 

### Quick Installation

You can run the script (`setup_prot-on.sh`) to quickly deploy the PROT-ON web server. Or you can follow [instuctions](/Step_by_Step_Deploying.md) to deploy the server step by step.

#### To Run the PROT-ON Webserver

Initiate two terminal tabs on the PROT-ON working directory, and run the following commands to start background and scheduled tasks, respectively (You must run these commands out of the environment). Note that, if any change or bugs occur in the scripts, please rerun these and the supervisor command below.

```
sudo celery -A app.celery worker --loglevel=info
sudo celery -A app.celery beat --loglevel=info
```
and

```
sudo service supervisor restart
```

### PROT-ON Output Files

* **Interface amino acid list:** Interfacial amino acid list (within a defined cut-off), belonging to the input chain ID, calculated by interface_residues.py. The same script outputs the pairwise contacts, as a Pairwise distance list.

* **Mutation models:** Generated mutant models modeled by BuildMutant command of EvoEF1 or BuildModel command of FoldX.

* **Individual EvoEF1/FoldX files:** EvoEF1/FoldX binding affinity predictions calculated by ComputeBinding of EvoEF1 or AnalyseComplex of FoldX (proton_scores).

* **Boxplot of EvoEF1/FoldX scores:** All EvoEF1/FoldX binding affinity predictions are analyzed with the box-whisker statistics, where;

* **Depleting mutations:** are defined by the positive outliers, and;

* **Enriching mutations:** are defined by the negative outliers.

* **Heatmap of PROT-ON scores:** All possible mutation energies are plotted as a heatmap for visual inspection.

* **Filtered mutations:** Stability-filtered (uses ComputeStability command of EvoEF1 or Stability command of FoldX, where DDG-stability<0) enriching and depleting mutations and optionally PSSM-filtered (Enriching mutations with PSSM-score >0 && Depleting mutations with PSSM-score <=0).

* **Heatmap_df:** A data frame used to generate the heatmap.

* **Parameters:** Includes the submitted cut-off and IQR ranges.

### For Future Updates

This section includes valuable information for future updates of PROT-ON codes. If you want to update anything, please follow the below instructions.

* **To define a new alert:** First, define your alert code as a function in `alert.py`, then call it in the "Check" function in the `app.py` script. ([See for more information](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/patterns/flashing/)) 

* **To add a new analyzing method:** If you want to add a new analysis method to PROT-ON, you must first create an object-oriented script to analyze the input structure, similar to __energy_calculation_EvoEF1.py__. Then, import it into `app.py`. Finally, call it in the `proton` function.

* **To define a new celery task:** If you want to define a new Celery task, you need to follow a few steps. First, define a task in the Flask configuration section in the `app.py` script. Next, create a new task function. Before the function, add the __@celery_task__ decorator. Finally, create a script such as **task.py**, import it into **app.py** and call it wherever you need ([See for more information](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/main/userguide/tasks.html))

* **To edit the e-mail address or e-mail content:** E-mail configuration settings are present in the `app.py` script. To change the e-mail address press `command/ctrl + f`, type `Fill with your e-mail here`, and edit all with your e-mail. If needed please change the **MAIL_SERVER, MAIL_PORT, and MAIL_USE_TLS** settings. If you want to change mail content, please edit the `SendMail` function in the `app.py`. 

* **To edit pre-calculated run results:** If you want to edit pre-calculated run results, you can add or drop folders in the **periodic_task** function in the **app.py** script.

* **To edit the result page:** You can manipulate the `ResultPage` function in the *app.py* and `result.html` script to edit the result page template. 

* **To edit the homepage** You can manipulate the `index.html` script to change the homepage template. Additionally, you can edit the `result` function in the `app.py` script if any changes occur in the index form.

* **To edit statistical methods:** You can directly manipulate the `detect_outliers.py` script if any edits are necessary for the statistical analysis methods.

* **Other HTML pages:** `Layouts.html` file serves as a layout page and is inherited by many other HTML pages. The `pre_calculated_runs.html` file includes information about pre-calculated runs. The files`404.html, about.html, help.html, refresh.html` are static pages. These pages are returned for specific purposes: **404.html** for page not found errors, **about.html** for information about the algorithm, **help.html** for some usage instructions, and **refresh.html** for waiting for the results. There are also some HTML pages under the *includes* folder. The **footer.html** is used for the footer section of pages, the **messages.html** is used for flash messaging, and the **navbar.html** is used for accessing the navigation menu.

You can refer to the accompanying flowchart that outlines these instructions below.
